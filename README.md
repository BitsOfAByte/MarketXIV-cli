### Features
- ðŸ”¥ Super Fast Responses: Get the information you need in a split second
- ðŸ”§ Built-in Updater: All executable updates are handled for you (Manual Installs)
- ðŸ“¦ Lightweight: Uses hardly any system storage or resources.
- âš¡ Powerful: Can fetch all the information you'd ever need.

### From Source
Build MarketXIV directly from the source for your system. Only recommended for advanced users that prefer to build from source or contributors.
<details>  
<summary>Show Steps</summary>

1. Make sure you have [Go](https://go.dev/) installed on your system and setup properly, alternatively use the [Devcontainer](./.devcontainer) setup.
2. Install [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/) if you want to build using the supported buildsystem (Optional unless contributing)
3. Run `make build` to build the binary for your system, or `make build-all` to build for all supported systems. You can optionally use `./build/scripts/upx.sh <file>` to compress the binary with UPX (This is done automatically when using make and having GoReleaser installed with `SKIP_COMPRESS=false` set)
4. You will find all the binaries in the `./dist` directory alongside any other build artifacts.
